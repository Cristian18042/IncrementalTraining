# IncrementalTraining

These codes are part of an incremental training methodology tested on Complex Motor Imagery data. The results were submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentations and Mesurements.

To use it you only have to modify in MLP (main code) the section to load the data. Inside the repository the power characteristics extracted from the signals are given with the variable called PSD1.
